# atom-keyboard-cheatsheet
A printable, graphical cheatsheet of Atom's Keyboard Commands(http://atom.io). Suitable for printing, laminating, helping learn or teach the commands used with the application. 

The CheatSheet is created in Adobe Illustrator. It is designed to be printed on 11x17 sized paper or to be used on-screen. It covers the default set of keyboard commands that are installed initially with Atom. 

Please submit any suggestions, additions of corrections as Issues and I'll try to incorporate them.
