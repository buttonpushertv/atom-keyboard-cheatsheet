# atom-keyboard-cheatsheet
A printable, graphical cheatsheet of Atom's Keyboard Commands(http://atom.io). Suitable for printing, laminating, helping learn or teach the commands used with the application. 

The CheatSheet is created in Adobe Illustrator. It is designed to be printed on 11x17 sized paper or to be used on-screen. It covers the default set of keyboard commands that are installed initially with Atom.

Currently this is tailored for the Windows version of Atom. Soon we will have OSX & Linux versions (although, for the most part, under OSX, where ever you see "Control," just replace it with "Command" and it should work.) 

Please submit any suggestions, additions of corrections as Issues and I'll try to incorporate them.
