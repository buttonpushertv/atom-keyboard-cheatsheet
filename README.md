# atom-keyboard-cheatsheet
A printable, graphical cheatsheet of Atom's Keyboard Commands(http://atom.io). Suitable for printing, framing, laminating, or helping to learn or to teach the commands used within the application.

The CheatSheet is created in Adobe Illustrator. It is designed to be printed on 11x17 sized paper or to be used on-screen. It covers the default set of keyboard commands that are installed initially with Atom. There are Light & Dark mode versions.

Currently this is tailored for the Windows version of Atom. Soon we will have OSX & Linux versions (although, for the most part, under OSX, where ever you see "Control," just replace it with "Command" and it should work.)

To make use of this CheatSheet, download any 1 of these versions:

Please submit any suggestions, additions of corrections as Issues and I'll try to incorporate them. This is just a little side thing I do, so I can't promise rapid turn-around on revisions, but I do use this myself, on the regular, so I'm open to what others think should be in there.
